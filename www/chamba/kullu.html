                <h5>Kullu-Manali Treks</h5>
                <p>Manali is a high-altitude Himalayan resort town in India’s northern Himachal Pradesh state. It has a reputation as a backpacking center and honeymoon destination. Set on the Beas River, it’s a gateway for skiing in the Solang Valley and trekking in Parvati Valley. It's also a jumping-off point for paragliding, rafting and mountaineering in the Pir Panjal mountains.</p><p id="text-collapse" class="hide">Many Trekking Routes are available in Manali. Major treks in Manali are Beas Kund Trek, Bhrigu Lake Trek, Chandrakhani Trek, Chandra Taal Trek and many more. Manali is a year-round magnet. Backpackers come to hang out in the hippie villages around the main town; adventurers come for trekking, climbing, mountain biking, canyoning, paragliding, rafting and skiing; and Indian families and honeymooners come for the cool mountain air and a taste of snow on a day trip to the Rohtang La. Manali is also the main jumping-off point (between June and October) for Ladakh and Spiti. It makes sense to unwind and feed up here for a few days while organizing your trip into the mountains. Most International travellers stay in the villages of Vashisht or Old Manali. Manali is at a height of 2050 meters and spreads along the banks of the gurgling Beas River. Kullu is a broad open valley formed by the Beas river between Manali and Largi. This valley is famous for its temples, beauty and its majestic hills covered with pine and deodar forest and sprawling apple orchards. The course of the Beas river presents a succession of magnificent, clad with forests of deodar, towering above trees of pine on the lower rocky ridges. Kullu valley is sandwiched between the Pir Panjal, Lower Himalayan and Great Himalayan range. Kullu area is known for Kullu shawl, made of many natural fibers including pashmina, sheep-wool and angora.</p><a id="showHide" class="right btn" onclick="app.showHide('showHide','text-collapse');">Show More</a>

                <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Chandrakhani Pass is one of the most beautiful and serene pass, at an altitude of 3660 m located in the Kullu valley. Chandrakhani Pass offers fabulous views of the Deo Tibba peak, Pir Panjal and Parbati range of mountains. The trek is one of the most beautiful treks that introduces the traveler to the remote, hilly cultures of Himachal Pradesh. Legend has that Jamlu (the presiding deity at Malana), opened a basket containing the gods of Kullu at the Chandrakhani Pass and the strong winds blew the gods to their present abodes. Below the Chandarkhani pass of the Kullu valley lies a small cluster of around two hundred stone roof houses constituting a village called Malana. Its inimitable culture and the temple of Jamlu distinguish the village. Malana stands out as an autonomous self-sufficient unit whose inhabitants claim Greek ancestry. Malana is connected to Kullu by three mountain passes - it can be reached from Parbati valley crossing over the 3180 metres rashol pass and via Naggar over the 3600 metres beautiful Chanderkhani pass. For the outsiders, there is a long list of do's and don'ts to be followed in the village. The people are friendly but outsiders are told to keep distance and not to touch anything in the village. Kanashi, the language of Malana, does not resemble any of the dialects spoken in its neighbourhood but seems to be a mixture of Sanskrit and several Tibetan dialects. Two important festivals are celebrated in Malana. One called Badoh Mela is celebrated in august and the other called Fagdi mela in February.</p>

Its inimitable culture and the temple of Jamlu distinguish the village.  The village consists of around 1500 inhabitants and has an impeccable system of administration with a higher and lower court guided by the spirit of village God Jamlu.  Malana stands out as an autonomous self-sufficient unit whose inhabitants claim Greek ancestry.
Malana is connected to Kulu by three mountain passes - it can be reached from Parbati valley crossing over the 3180 metres Rashol Pass and via Nagar over the 3600 metres beautiful Chanderkhani pass.  The easiest way to reach Malana is from Jari. Jari is two hours drive from Kulu and is situated at the confluence of the Malana and Manikaran nallah, which join to form the Parbati River. Jari is an entry point to Malana.  About 1.5 km. Malana is divided into two - upper Malana (Dhara Beda) and lower Malana (Sor Beda).  Malana is inhabited by only Rajputs.   The shrine of Renuka Devi is situated in lower Malana.  The Shrine with its intricate woodwork is noteworthy for its architectural excellence.  Horns of animals sacrificed in the temple complex are usually fixed on the facade of the temple.</p>
