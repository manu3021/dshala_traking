Heavy snowfall and semi-arctic climate makes the living very tough here. Recently Killar, the headquarters of Pangi, has been linked with a jeepable road which, however, remains in use for merely two months in a year due to adverse weather conditions. It is a place where myth is history and mystery is reality. Remarkable in its rugged grandeur, austere and exquisite beauty, it is a trekkers' paradise. Pangi has many unknown destinations, unsealed peaks and breath-taking trek routes. In fact, till now the access to the valley is through the old routes—across Sach pass, Cheni pass and via Jammu & Kashmir.</p>

This Pass is very risky at the time of snowfall or over fresh snow for tracking as crevasses open up on Lahaul side in monsoon months and are difficult to negotiate. Gaddis also sacrifice few sheep’s when they are crossing Chobia Pass to the Goddess Marali for safe and easy crossing. Few of shepherd also cross another Pass in Lauhal known as Baralacha pass as grass of Lauhal and Spiti is much nutrient than other grasses; this is the main reason to go to Lauhal and Spiti with their flocks. June is the best month for trekking this pass. Chobia Pass lies between 2 minor peaks Tent Peak (6133m ) and Barakanda Peak (5877 ) of the Pir Panjal Ranges.</p>

Kalihani Pass at an altitude of approximately (4830 meters) is a tricky negotiation through ice, snow on glacier, and moraine. A small and beautiful glacial lake waits on the descent of the pass. For Bara Bhanghal you can trek from Manali over Kaliheni Pass, Bir Billing over Thamsar Pass also have access from Bharmour.

Since altitude is less and grade is moderate it is most freqented by locals crossing over to Kangra. People from Bhara Bhangal cross Jalsu Pass with their cattle when Thamsar Pass closes. The pass opens up very early. Those used to walking in snow can cross it even in May and November. Jalsu is an experience in itself. The rolling grasslands with vegetation extending deep into the trail, sprinkling of conifers, rhododendron bushes and the beautiful yellow grass flowers offer a colourful experience which few other passes can match. Unlike other Dhauladhar passes, its beauty is not in the bareness and rockiness but in the variety of vegetation it supports and colours it shows on both sides. You also meet a lot of people on the way, shepherds, shopkeepers, tourists. So, if you are here to meet people, understand culture while also appreciating the views, this is the pass for you. Pir Panjal ranges are visible but the perspective is completely different. Being a popular shepherd trail, there are lots of temporary stops with food and shelter on offer.</p>

You will need our trained crew for crossing this dangerous and mysterious pass. It involves steep ascent and long walk on snows and technical route negotiation. The highest peak of this region Matterhorn (4946 meters) is north-west of this pass and Talang Pass serves as a base camp for climbing this beautiful peak. The name of the pass is derived from the local god Talang whose abode is supposed to be at the top of this pass. There are two very beautiful lakes near the pass (one is small though and called Dali) while the bigger one is called Arjun ka Talab and is the source of Bander khud. There are many beautiful waterfalls near the pass. This pass offers a commanding view of Manimahesh Kailash rage and Pir Panjals. There is a temple at the top of the pass made of rock slabs, cairns, tridents, bells dedicated to lord Talang.</p>

                <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Waru pass lies to the northwest to Singhar Pass. Waru means “The gateway of Wind” and winds with very high velocity blow over this pass. The trek passes throught a number of intermediary ridges, dense forest, rivulets and snow nullahs. This trek is an easy one and poses no difficulty even for trekkers with little experience in trekking. Situated at 3850 meters, locals use this pass frequently to cross from Palampur to Chamba. Enroute Waru Pass we will get to see mesmerizing views of Dhauladhars, Kangra and Chamba valley. We will also cross Satchali, which has got it's name from seven different rivulets mingling together. It's a beautiful glacier. The chirping of the birds intermingled with the murmur of streams flowing down the valley makes the atmosphere very enchanting. There are some improved huts of Gujjars and shepherds and a rock shelter.</p>
