                </div>
                <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Not many trekkers challenge themselves with this trail. Yet, it is one of the best treks you will ever do in your life. Rupin Pass trek consists of trails dug out of rock faces and wooden bridges, cut through deep dark folds in the mountain, glaciers and icy slopes, and over snow fields. Along the way there are white Rhododendrons and expanse of green meadows. The Pass is perched at 4600m in the surreal Himalayan mountain range of Himachal Pradesh. Based on the intensity of the snow, this path might get challenging at times. Throughout, you will be greeted with stunning scenery such as cascades, verdant meadows, snow-kissed mountains, charming hamlets and big rivers. The delights of the tour include trekking amidst rhododendron woodlands, fields and ascending pictorial meadows. You will also have to brace yourself for climbing up snowy patches. As you make your way through some hamlets, get a fine whiff of their local culture and lives. Also, enjoy fabulous views of Kinner Kailash range along with the hamlets that dot the Sangla Valley.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Located in Kinnaur Valley of Himachal Pradesh state of India, Mount Kinner Kailash (6050 m) is listed among one of the five mount Kailash. This place is believed to be the home of Load Shiva from where he regulates the Universe. The Parikrama or circumambulation at this place starts from Kalpa via Triung valley and back to Kalpa via Sangla valley. Many pilgrims visit this sacred place every year. Mount Kinner Kailash holds a religious significance among the Hindus because of the huge "SHIVA LINGAM", which is a 79 feet vertical rock formation that looks like a Shivlinga. This rock formed representation of Lord Shiva believes to change its colors throughout the day. Situated at Indo-Tibet boarder, entry to Kinnaur valley was restricted even for Indian nationals till 1993 and even today for foreign nations, tourists from foreign countries need to register themselves with Inner line permit. This trek will take you to the land of fairy tales from where you can have a stunning view of cold desert mountains, snow-clad peaks, lush green valleys and fields of beautiful orchard flowers. Also, you can witness amazing view of the spectacular landscape. Kinnaur is the most scenic but less known district of Himachal Pradesh, located on the Indo-Tibet border. It is surrounded by Tibet on the east, Garhwal Himalaya trek on the south, Spiti Valley on the north and Kullu on the west. The Sutlej River, which rises on the southern slopes of Kailash Parvat near Mansarovar in Tibet flows through the Kinnaur valley. Due to the proximity of Kinnaur to Tibet, the life style and religion of its inhabitants had been influenced by Buddhism, mostly in the northern and central regions, although the majority of the people practice Hinduism.</p>
